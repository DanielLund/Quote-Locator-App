# Quote-Locator-App
The initial stage of development interacted with the homepage of "quotes.toscrape.com" utilising the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the quotes using the HTML and CSS tags
Furthering this development, I then used selenium webdriver to incorporate browser automation into the application, this then allows me to interact with JavaScript elements on the website.
Finally error handling was added along with an implicit wait using By, expected_conditions and WebDriverWait from the selenium webdriver libraries to make sure the program doesn't run faster than the website.
